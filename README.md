and backups. Not too many features currently exist so send

  seeds or downloaded maps

structure this project properly lmao. I thought python was
supposed to be EASY bro why is python project management

# Changelog

- (v 0.2.0) Backup extraction can now be configured
- (v 0.3.0) Added a sound effect that plays when you extract
